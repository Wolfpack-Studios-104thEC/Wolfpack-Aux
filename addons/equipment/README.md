## Macros

Within the equipment PBO, there is a `script_macros.hpp` which stores all macro information for this PBO.  
If you need to expand upon or search how something works, please look there.

Within the equipment PBO, there is also a `script_component.hpp`.  
This stores information required for the PBO to function, including:
- Armor values
- Storage values
- Base macros used across all subaddons
